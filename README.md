# Human cortical auditory atlas
Resources from our cortical auditory areas project that combines the gold-standard human histology images from [**JuBrain**](https://jubrain.fz-juelich.de) with state of the art in-vivo human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at ultra-high fields (7 Tesla). More specifically:

1. We use the individual brains to create a cyto-architectonic surface atlas that is optimized for the human auditory cortex:

2. We make use of our atlas in combination with ultra-high field MRI to visualize the underlying in-vivo measurements such as myelination and tonotopy:
