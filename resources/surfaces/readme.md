Use `SRF_to_OBJ_conversion.m` script to convert `.srf` surface meshes into `.obj` format which can be loaded in many 3D mesh visualization software (e.g. [MeshLab](https://www.meshlab.net/)).

Note that this conversion script is also useful in you want to convert the `.srf` files into any other mesh format.
