# Data
Surface atlas resides at <https://osf.io/4mjpn/>. Particularly:
- `cytoarchitectonic_auditory_atlas` folder for the atlas regions and surface files. Areas of this atlas are generated by using surface alignment with anatomical priors (aka [CBA+](resources/CBAplus_steps/README.md)) on individually reconstructed subset of JuBrain images (from here: <https://kg.ebrains.eu/search/instances/Dataset/ff71a4d1-ea14-4ed6-898e-b92d95b3c446>). The group average JuBrain surface is then registered to our invivo group average surface to transfer these files onto the invivo group average surface.
- `individual_invivo_MRI_surface_data` folder for the surfaces of our 7T MRI data (the source images can be found in: <https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001942/versions/1.2.0>). These surfaces are aligned by using [CBA+](resources/CBAplus_steps/README.md) method and the resulting group average middle gray matter surface is used to host the cytoarchitectonic atlas areas.

# File format
Use `SRF_to_OBJ_conversion.m` script to convert `.srf` surface meshes into `.obj` format which can be loaded in many 3D mesh visualization software (e.g. [MeshLab](https://www.meshlab.net/)).

Note that this conversion script is also useful in you want to convert the `.srf` files into any other mesh format.
